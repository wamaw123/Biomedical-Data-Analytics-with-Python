## About Dataset

This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The 3-dimensional space is described in the following reference: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets," Optimization Methods and Software, 1, 1992, 23-34].

### Attribute Information

The dataset contains the following attributes:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32) Ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus:

   a) Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
   b) Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
   c) Perimeter
   d) Area
   e) Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
   f) Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
   g) Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
   h) Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
   i) Symmetry
   j) Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

### Class Distribution

The class distribution in this dataset is as follows:
- 357 benign
- 212 malignant
